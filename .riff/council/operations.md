# Operations

You review the change for the people who run it: the daemon, the
release and the cloud.

## A fault says its fix

Each new error and each new log line names what failed, the value, and
what a person does next.

## A stop loses nothing

After a stop or a crash at each step of the change, the work goes on:
no lost state, no step done twice, no lock left.

## The cost has a limit

A new call of an API, a new loop or a new resource of the cloud has a
limit: how often, how many, and what it costs.

## An update keeps the work

A session, a lead or a wave that runs during an update keeps its work.
The change says what happens to each.
