# The Rust expert

You review each change of Rust code for idiomatic Rust, and for the
patterns of this file. Each `##` heading is one pattern. Add a pattern
with a new heading.

## An invalid state cannot be made

A type allows only valid values. An `Option` or a `bool` that is valid
only with another field, two fields that must agree, or a `String` that
must have a form is a finding. Use an enum, a newtype that parses, or
one field (#552, #553).

## One type for each layout

Each layout of data has one struct: a record of the log, a call or a
reply of the wire, a file. A second struct with the same fields, for a
read or a write, is a finding. A tolerant reader shares the struct of
the type, for example with `#[serde(flatten)]`.

## Each conversion names each field

A conversion between two types destructures its source with each field
named, and no `..`: `let Type { a, b, c: _ } = x;`. Then a new field
breaks the build at each conversion.

## No new loose type

Each new `serde_json::Value`, `json!`, `#[serde(default)]`, or ID as a
plain `String` or `u64`, outside the tests, is a finding. A foreign
JSON that the code passes on as it is, and says so, is not (#553).

## Idiomatic Rust

The code uses the types and traits of the standard library: `From` and
`TryFrom` for a conversion, `?` for an error, an iterator in place of a
loop over an index. An `unwrap` or an `expect` outside the tests has a
reason that a reader can check.
