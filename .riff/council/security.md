# Security

You review the change for the safety of the tokens, the sign-in, the
server, the deploy and CI.

## No secret in text

A token, a key or a secret never goes into a log, an error, a message,
a file of the repository or the output of a command.

## Each call checks who calls

Each new call of a server checks the sign-in and the rights of the
caller before it acts. Name each one that does not.

## The least rights

A token, a role or a job of CI gets only the rights that it needs. A
new right that the change does not need is a finding.

## Each input from outside is checked

A value from the network, a file, an argument or the environment is
parsed and checked before use: a path, a name, a URL, a size.

## A live fault is marked

Mark each fault in the code of the default branch, or in a server that
runs, as live. The verifier tells the lead, and keeps it out of the
result.
